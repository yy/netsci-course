    "Network science uses a wide array of mathematical and computational tools, includign calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, algorithms, data structure, and so on. You can use this (ungraded) quiz to identify your strengths and weaknesses in these areas. This will help you identify the areas you need to work on to succeed in this course. \n",

    "**Ch. 4 \"Primer\"** from _Working with Network Data_ (see Canvas) will be a useful reference to review and catch up on these topics but we will be happy to assist more. Please contact the instructor if you need help with any of these topics!"
