    "\n",
    "Setting up and maintaing Python environments can be painful! Python project has not been particularly good with dependency management systems. Python is easy to pick up and start coding because it's interpreted language. Also as a result of this approachability, there are so many users and usecases. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good thing, but it also contributes to the messiness of the Python ecosystem. For use cases where performance is vital (e.g., machine learning and scientific computing) â€” because Python is a slow, interpreted language â€” people had to write performance-critical code in C/C++/Fortran and wrap them in Python. This is great for performance, but it makes dependency management even more complicated.\n",

In such cases, whether you can set up and manage your Python environment, and whether you can successfully install and use a single critical package, can make or break your project.\n",

It can help you understand how your computer and Python work under the hood. Therefore, I encourage you to constantly learn how to set up and manage Python environments and packages!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Problem with having a single global environment\n",
    "Imagine a data scientist, Alice, who works on two very different projects. In one project, she is working on a machine learning model, which requires a cutting-edge package that is being actively developed. This package makes use of the most recent features (and thus most recent versions) of other foundational packages (e.g., the lastest version of `numpy`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In another project, she is debugging and maintaining a legacy codebase that breaks if she uses a recent version of `numpy`. What should she do in this situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice installs the latest version of `numpy` globally, she will not be able to test the legacy codebase, which requires an older version of `numpy`, and vice versa. She can potentially buy a new computer for each project, but that's just not practical. ðŸ¤‘\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: virtual environments\n",
    "The solution is to use **virtual environments**! A virtual environment is a self-contained environment that contains its own version of software packages. Whether the package is a pure Python code or some binary code, there is nothing wrong with keeping multiple versions in the same computer, as long as they are isolated from each other and we can clearly specify which version to use for each project. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what all virtual environment tools do. Usually a virtual environment is essentially a folder somewhere in your computer (e.g., in your project directory or a dedicated directory for virtual environments) that contains a copy of Python and other packages. When you _activate_ a virtual environment, it modifies your `PATH` environment variable so that you use whatever in your virtual environment instead of the global version. Then when you _deactivate_ the virtual environment, it restores the `PATH` variable to its original state.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is `venv`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`venv` is a built-in module in Python that allows us to create isolated virtual environments. Remember that you can think of each virtual environment as a directory that contains Python libraries, each with a specific version. This isolation means you can work on multiple Python projects with different dependencies on the same machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).\n",
    "- Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment using the `cd` command.\n",
    "- Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python -m venv myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python3 -m venv myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What does it do?** This command creates a new directory named `myenv` (or whatever you name it) in your current directory. This directory will contain the Python interpreter, a copy of the `pip` package manager, and other necessary files. It's a self-contained environment where you can install packages without affecting the global Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this step does not _activate_ your virtual environment. You need to activate it to use it. \n",

    "**What does this do?** Activating the virtual environment adjusts your shellâ€™s environment variables so that when you run `python`, it uses the environmentâ€™s Python interpreter and when you run `pip`, it manages the environmentâ€™s packages. It changes your prompt to show the name of the activated environment to let you know that you're using a virtual environment. Always pay attention to which environment you're using!\n",

    "\n",
    "Although `venv` may be all you need for many use cases (including this course), there are more powerful tools. One such tool, probably the most popular for data science, is Anaconda. It is optional to use Anaconda for this course, but I recommend you to play with it and see if it works for you. It also provides a nice graphical user interface (GUI) for managing environments, which may be helpful for you if you are not comfortable with the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Anaconda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is not just a virtual environment management tool, but a complete Python distribution that comes with many useful packages for data science. It is often prefered by data scientists because it comes with many packages pre-installed, and it is easy to install additional packages, even those that are nontrivial to install using `pip`. Another feature is that it comes as an isolated environment (a single folder), so it is easy to use and manage even if you are working in a shared computer that you do not have admin access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply follow the instructions on the website based on your operating system. The default installation comes with Python and many useful packages for data science.\n",
    "It also installs the `conda`, a command-line tool for managing environments. You can think of `conda` as a combined tool that does more or less what `venv` and `pip` do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to use Anaconda. If you are not yet comfortable with the command line, you can use the Anaconda Navigator GUI. If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the `conda` command. I will not go into details here, but you can find many tutorials online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a virtual environment with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a virtual environment is similar to `venv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, conda does not create the virtual environment (folder) in the current directory. Instead, it creates it in a specific directory that is dedicated to all conda environments. The location will depend on your environment and conda will tell you when you create an environment. It also does some \"magic\" in the background that we will not go into details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of conda, compared with `venv`, is that it allows you to specify which version of Python you want to use. For example, if you want to use Python 3.8, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name myenv python=3.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is much more straightforward to use a specific version of Python with conda than with `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created a conda environment, you can activate it using the `conda activate` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install packages using `conda install` command. For example, to install `networkx`, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh  \n",
    "conda install networkx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks more or less the same as `pip install`. However, conda is more powerful than `pip` in that it can install packages that are not pure Python packages that cannot be installed with `pip`. Although it is becoming easier to install such packages with `pip`, there are still some packages that are tricky to install with `pip`. This is where anaconda/conda shines and the reason why so many data science projects use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, conda does not \"know\" every single package out there, particularly those that are not related to data science, that can be installed with `pip`. So, you'd often need to use both `conda` and `pip` to install all the packages you need, which is annoying and confusing! Making things even more complicated, there are conda channels, which are like package repositories, that contain packages that are not available in the default conda channel. You may not need to worry about this for this course and as long as you don't go deep into cutting-edge packages, but it is something to keep in mind.\n",

    "\n",
    "It also creates a \"lock file\" (`poetry.lock`) that contains the exact versions of the packages installed in the environment. This is similar to `requirements.txt` file, but it is more precise. For example, if you specify `numpy>=1.19.0` in `pyproject.toml`, it will install the latest version of `numpy` that satisfies the requirement (e.g., `1.19.5`), and it will be recorded in `poetry.lock`. This allows you to more easily reproduce the exact environment in another computer.\n",

Second, you don't have to worry about setting up environments and whatever you have on the cloud tend to be exactly replicable. Usually, these cloud environments are pre-configured with all the necessary software, so you can start working on your project right away.

    "People realized that this ability to converse with a programming language can be incredibly powerful for data science (and scientific computing in general). For instance, when you load a big tabular dataset, it is super useful to be able to explore the dataset interactively and process the data step by step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine writing a script that performs a series of complicated data processing operations and analyses, where each step depends on the results of the previous steps. To develop this script without any interactivity, you need to go through a tedious loop of (1) writing the initial script, (2) running it, (3) checking the results, and (4) going back to step (1) to change the script. This is not only tedious but also error-prone. Moreover, as the size of the data increases, this process becomes more and more inefficient. You will need to wait for a long time for each iteration. \n",

    "### The idea of computational/computable document\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the pioneer who realized this potential for the first time was Mathematica, a popular software for mathematical computing. It provides a powerful interface where you can interactively create a document that contains text, code, and visualizations. This document can not only present the results of an analysis, but it can also contain the code that can be executed to reproduce the results and even modified to explore alternatives. This was a revolutionary idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it was not free and open-source, and it was not Python! This great idea began to spread to other languages, leading to the IPython and Jupyter project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### IPython notebook and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython (Interactive Python) project was a nice attempt to bring this idea to Python. It was a command-line tool (an IDLE replacement) that allowed you to interactively write and execute Python code. It also implemented the idea of computational document, via \"IPython notebook\", which was pretty much what Mathematica was doing, but without the fancy GUI and limited ability to create and interact with visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of its capacity, it was not a match for Mathematica, but it was free and open-source, and it was Python! It was also a great tool for data science, and it became very popular among data scientists. This eventually lead to the creation of Jupyter project. \n",
    "\n",
    "- https://jupyter.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter project was born because the same idea can be applied to many other languages besides Python, and because people realized that it is possible to extract the _interface_ of IPython notebook and make it language-agnostic (and web-based!). Whatever interpreted language we use, we can have the exactly same interface that does not care about what language people are inputting. And then the language interpreter can interpret the code and return the results to the interface.\n",

    "The name Jupyter came from the combination of Julia, Python, and R, the three languages that the Jupyter project initially supported (now it supports many more).\n",

It is under an active development and this is what you want to use in most cases. \n",

    "### \"Kernels\" and ipykernel\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that may be quite confusing at first, especially with respect to the virtual environments, is the concept of \"kernel\". Let's say you have created a virtual environment and then ran `jupyter lab` in the terminal. If you're using Jupyter for the first time, I'd bet that your natural assumption is that Jupyter lab is using the virtual environment you have created and you can use all the packages that you have just installed. But that's not the case! ðŸ˜¬\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, Jupyter is _language-agnostic web interface_. It does not care about what language you are using. It just sends the code you write to the language interpreter and returns the results. So, you need to tell Jupyter which language (and which _version_!) you want to use. This is what \"kernel\" means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say, you have created a virtual environment named `myenv` and installed `networkx` in it. The Python interpreter in this virtual environment knows about `networkx`, but Jupyter does not know about this particular python interpreter (a \"kernel\") and `myenv` environment until we tell it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we let Jupyter know about our virtual environment and corresponding kernel (Python interpreter)? Here is the steps that we need to take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install `ipykernel` in the virtual environment.\n",
    "2. Register the virtual environment as a kernel.\n",
    "3. Run Jupyter lab and select the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install `ipykernel` in the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install `ipykernel` in the virtual environment. This is a package that allows us to register the virtual environment as a kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Register the virtual environment as a kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to register the virtual environment as a kernel. This is done by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will register the current virtual environment as a kernel named `myenv`. You can check this by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then when we open Jupyter lab, we can select the kernel we want to use. Whenever we open a new or existing notebook, we can select or change the kernel by clicking `Kernel -> Change kernel` in the menu bar. When you change the kernel, it brings all the packages installed in the corresponding virtual environment.\n",

    "### A convenient way to work with Jupyter notebooks: VSCode and other IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "VSCode and other IDEs let you work with Jupyter notebooks more or less in the same way as JupyterLab (remember that Jupyter is just a language-agnostic interface for Python and other languages). It also removes a lot of tedious steps that you need to take with JupyterLab. For example, you don't need to install `ipykernel` and register the virtual environment as a kernel. VSCode handles that and let you simply choose the virtual environment you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly recommend to use VS Code for this course and for general data science in general. It is a great IDE with a powerful plugin ecosystem. \n",
