    "## Why random graphs?\n",
    "In an early assignment we compared a BA network with an ER graph and saw that the degree distribution and shortest path length were quite different. If all we wanted to know was how the degree distributions were different, then an ER graph isn't an unreasonable choice. However, as you learned in the reading and from looking at several different real world graphs you should be aware by now that most graphs don't have a simple poisson degree distribution. So while the ER graph is a simple model, it unfortunately isn't a good null model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Null models are often used in hypothesis testing to aid in the acceptance/rejection of some alternative hypothesis, the null being the default assumption. In network science null models can also be used for statistical hypothesis testing and for determining whether certain graph features are responsible for some characteristic of the graph or some pattern of behavior on the graph (e.g. epidemic models or random walkers). \n",
    "\n",
    "The null model should match some of the real graph's topological characteristics but should otherwise be random. The configuration model allows us to hold the degree sequence constant while investigating other graph characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to dolphins\n",
    "Lets build a mock hypothesis using the [dolphin social network](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/dolphins.zip). My hypothesis is that dolphins have a posh and very exclusive culture. Popular dolphins only hang with other popular dolphins, while the loners are stuck to mingle among themselves. A sad state of affairs, but social life is hard in the pods. How might we test this?\n",
    "\n",
    "There happens to be a similarity measure called [assortativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assortativity) where nodes of a certain type tend to be connected to nodes of the same type. In networkx there is a function called [degree assortativity](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.assortativity.degree_assortativity_coefficient.html?highlight=degree_assortativity_coefficient#networkx.algorithms.assortativity.degree_assortativity_coefficient) which tells us how strongly nodes of similar degree are attached to each other. If the network has high degree assortativity, then low degree nodes will be connected to other low degree nodes, and high degree nodes will be connected to other high degree nodes. Conversely, low degree assortativity (or even disassortativity) would imply no (or negative) relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent, so we have a measure, but what do we compare our graph too? It wouldn't really be appropriate to compare it to an ER graph because the nodes all have different degrees which are about the same and normally distributed. Instead, we want to compare our dolphin network to a graph with the same degree distribution, and that is where the configuration model comes in."

    "## Testing the dolphin hypothesis\n",
    "We are going to do a rough test for our hypothesis by calculating the z-score for our dolphin network's degree assortativity coefficient. We will do this by generating a bunch of configuration models based on the dolphin degree sequence and calculating the assortativity coefficient for those null graphs. We can then compare our real network with the null model. If our z-score is high then it is unlikely that the dolphin network's assortativity can be accounted for by just the degree-sequence of a random graph, which means something more interesting is at work.\n",

    "1. Pick a graph of your choosing. You can use the graphs you are using for your project or any other real-world graph. Here are a couple places you can find some: [pajek datasets](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/), [Newman's datasets](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/). [note: if you use directed graphs makes sure you use the corresponding function [`directed_configuration_model`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.degree_seq.directed_configuration_model.html?highlight=configuration_model#networkx.generators.degree_seq.directed_configuration_model)]\n",

Here is a [list of algorithms that networkx has](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html). You aren't limited by measures networkx can calculate. However, do not use a measure that depends entirely on the degree sequence. For instance, it would be silly to compare average degree to the random networks generated by the configuration model because it uses the same degree sequence and so will have the same average degree.\n",

    "3. Carry out a simple hypothesis test for both hypotheses. It can be similar to what I showed here. You are welcome to carry it out in a more robust manner, but the focus of this assignment is getting a hang of using configuration models as null models. Here is a link to [Statistics for Hackers](https://speakerd.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/7e68b43159d646cf81eda9e1bded8213/Statistics_for_Hackers_-_PyCon2016.pdf). It has a nice little python tutorial for how you can carry out hypothesis testing without all the hard math. Even if you don't use it for this assignment I highly recommend checking it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide quantitative analysis and a graphical illustration of your results. It should be clear that your hypothesis was validated/invalidated/inconclusive.\n",

    "5. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "  * What graph are you using?\n",
    "  * What are you hypotheses?\n",
    "  * What measures will you be using to test your hypotheses? How do these measures accomplish this?\n",
