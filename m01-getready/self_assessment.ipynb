    "This course requires good understanding of linear algebra, probability, statistics, and programming. This (ungraded) quiz lets you assess whether you have a good basis for taking this course. If you struggle with the following questions (the questions are supposed to be fairly trivial), you may need to put lots of efforts throughout your course. Of course we will do our best to help you if you are willing to learn."
