Create a function that takes `n` the number of nodes for the graph, and `m_o` the initial number of nodes, as arguments and returns a networkx graph with a scale-free degree distribution.\n",

    "The first step is figuring out how to do \"preferential attachment\" based on the degree of existing nodes. A brute-force way to do this is creating a huge list with duplicated items. Say, node 1's degree is 6, node 2's degree is 3, and node 3's degree is 2. (This is not a 'graphical' sequence. But for the sake of simplicity let's just assume that.) Then, we can create the following list to *preferentially sample* nodes from the network. "
