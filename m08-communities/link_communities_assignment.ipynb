This is because we want to color the edges according to their membership and not with a gradient. Additionally, in order to keep the edge colors when saving the graph you will need to make sure the edge color in the Preview tab is set to `original`.

    "3. In Gephi choose a good layout for the graph.\n",
    "4. Run the modularity command to generate communities for the nodes.\n",
    "5. Color the edges according to the link communities and the nodes according to the communities found by Gephi. Remember to take care in choosing the resolution parameter.\n",
    "6. How well does link clustering do at detecting community structure? How well does Gephi's node modularity do at detecting community structure? What do you think the communities represent? You can just provide a qualitative observation based on your intuition.\n",
