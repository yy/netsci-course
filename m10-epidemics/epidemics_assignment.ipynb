    "# Assignment: Building the SIS model\n",
    "The example SI model should give you a good starting point from which to create the SIS version. In the SIS model, infected nodes can transform back to susceptible nodes, which means you will have one additional parameter that needs to be provided as an argument to the model. Lets call this probability of reversion `mu`. You can either start with the SI function I provided and modify it into the SIS variant, or you can write your own function to taste. \n",
    "\n",
    "My implementation is simple but far from optimal, it will be slower to run on larger and more dense graphs. If you want more of a challenge try comming up with an SIS version that can run efficiently on larger graphs. This could be done by relying more heavily on numpy, which uses a c backend for array operations, or using a different network data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are your goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an SIS version of the function, either by building off of mine or making your own from scratch.\n",
    "2. Plot your model's results using a sparse random graph and play with the parameters to get a feel for how `mu`, `beta`, and `initial_inf` change the equilibrium point of the system. The equilibrium point occurs when the system settles on a stable fraction of infected (see Fig 10.7 in Barabasi's textbook). Also take note of how long it takes for the system to reach equilibrium.\n",
    "3. Finally, construct a graph like Fig 10.11 from Barabasi's book that shows the difference between Erdos-Renyi graphs and Scale-free graphs for the SIS-model. The Y-axis in the figure will be the equilibrium point of the system. This will generally be the last time point of your simulation, assuming you run it long enough to let it reach equilibrium. The X-axis is the parameter `lambda` which is just `beta / mu`. The exact location of the critical point for the SIS model on the ER graph will vary depending upon parameters, but the key take-away is that the Scale-free graph's is lower (and eventually vanishes depending upon scaling exponent). Lastly, remember to use averaging to smooth the curves over many trials for each data-point. Note: The BA algorithm only generates exponents of 3. You can generate a directed scale-free graph with varying power-law exponent using networkx's [`scafe_free_graph`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.directed.scale_free_graph.html?%20scale_free_graph#networkx.generators.directed.scale_free_graph) function. However, it needs to be converted to an undirected graph. You can make a power-law exponent of ~2.5 with the following parameters `alpha=0.35`, `beta=0.60`, `gamma=0.05`, `delta_in=0.4`, `delta_out=0.4`\n",
    "\n",
